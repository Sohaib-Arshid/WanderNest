## Setup and Install Dependencies

To get WanderNest running on your local machine, first clone the repository and then install all the required dependencies. All the packages needed for this project are already listed in the `package.json` file, so you don’t need to install anything manually. By running `npm install`, Node.js will automatically download and set up all the necessary packages, including Express.js for handling server routes, MongoDB driver for database operations, EJS for server-side templating, Tailwind CSS for styling, and other utility packages that the project uses. This ensures that your local environment has everything it needs to run the app smoothly. After installing the dependencies, you can create a `.env` file for your MongoDB connection and session secret, and then start the app using `npm start`.
